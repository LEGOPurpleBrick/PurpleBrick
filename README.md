# Features
* Viewing and changing player coordinates.
* Loading into map files.
* A custom Door Finder which allows you to see the properties of any GizDoor.
* A toggle switch to enable the effects of the N0CUT5 code.
* A toggle switch to enable the debug Streaming Display option, which displays what maps are loaded into memory.*
* Custom hotkey system to allow for faster execution of some features.

This is an early release and the program is still actively in development, therefore not every feature is supported in every game yet, please refer to the Supported Games section of this description to avoid confusion.

*This debug feature was removed after LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean, therefore it will only be available for a few games.
