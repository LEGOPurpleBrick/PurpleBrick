# Features
* Viewing and changing player coordinates.
* Loading into map files.
* A custom Door Finder which allows you to see the properties of any GizDoor.
* A toggle switch to enable the effects of the N0CUT5 code.
* A toggle switch to enable the debug Streaming Display option, which displays what maps are loaded into memory.*
* Custom hotkey system to allow for faster execution of some features.

This is an early release and the program is still actively in development, therefore not every feature is supported in every game yet, please refer to the Supported Games section of this description to avoid confusion.

If PurpleBrick fails to hook into a supported game, or some features that should be operational are not, please ensure:
* The name of the executable of the game is what it should be (example: doesn't have "unpacked" next to it's name if Steamless was used).
* You are running an un-modded version of the game.
